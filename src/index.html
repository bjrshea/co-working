        <p>At The Remoter, we believe that co-working spaces shouldn’t be specifc to one industry — they should be filled with different minded people creating different things. After all, we’ve found that it’s difficult to grow our imagination if we see the same things over and over again.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Well, welcome to the co-working space that’s a fit for all professionals, hobbiests, or learners! We have canvas stands, conference rooms that fit 10+ people, private working spaces, fresh coffee, beer, and kombucha, and more.</p>

        <p>We know that meeting new people isn’t always easy and that one of the pitfalls of a co-working space is that you’re not seeing the same faces every day.</p>
        <br>
        <p>With that said, The Remoter recognizes this and has plenty of networking every month for our members. These are free of charge and part of your monthly membership.</p>
        <br>
        <p>For folks who aren’t members, don’t you worry! Networking events are open to the public as well. Just check out our pricing page for more information on costs.</p>
