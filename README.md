## Creative Research & Process

_In order to get a feel for the market and the types of companies that are offering co-working spaces, I looked into the following companies for inspiration and research:_

[The Encorepreneur Cafe](http://encorepreneurcafe.com/)
[TechSpace](https://www.techspace.com/)
[WeWork](https://www.wework.com/)
[Centrl Office](https://centrloffice.com/)

_Once I had a feel for the layouts and what users expected to find on a company's website, I began sketching up a *very* rough draft on what my site will look like:_
