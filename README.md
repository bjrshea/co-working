# The Remoter

#### A mock up of a new co-working space coming to the Portland area.

#### By **Brendan Shea**

## Description

This project is mock-up of a fictional co-working space that's coming to the Portland area. The project includes user stories, research, mock-ups in Sketch, prototyping in Sketch, and fully functioning website.

## Getting Started

To use this download and use this project, make sure you have Node Package Manager (npm) installed on your machine. From there, enter the following commands in terminal from the Desktop directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/bjrshea/co-working.git
cd co-working
npm install
npm run start
```
After running these commands, you be able to make changes to the project and see those changes in the local server.

## The Creative Process

### User Stories

### Creative Research

In order to get a feel for the market and the types of companies that are offering co-working spaces, I reviewed the following websites for information and inspiration:

* [The Encorepreneur Cafe](http://encorepreneurcafe.com/)
* [TechSpace](https://www.techspace.com/)
* [WeWork](https://www.wework.com/)
* [Centrl Office](https://centrloffice.com/)
* [Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2015/05/why-people-thrive-in-coworking-spaces)

After reading through and reviewing those resources, I decided that my landing page should be more of a digital experience. I want the user to feel something when they open up the website. I want them to see themselves at this space and creating work that is meaningful to them._

Once I had a feel for the layouts, I began sketching up a very rough draft on what my site will look like on both mobile and web:

### Wireframing with Sketch

I used Sketch on this project to wireframe the different viewports a user will use with this application. First off, let's take a look at the mobile viewport:

![alt text](assets/images/mobile-3.png "Photo of mobile viewport.")

Second, let's take a look at the desktop viewport:

![alt text](assets/images/desktop-2.png "Photo of desktop viewport.")
![alt text](assets/images/desktop-3.png "Photo of desktop viewport.")

As you'll see, the mobile viewport condenses into a smaller version of the desktop viewport. The only real change is that the header will turn into a hamburger icon when the user is viewing the website from a mobile device or shrinks their viewport manually.

### Prototyping with Sketch

Sketch also served as a great tool for prototyping. If you're not familiar, prototyping is a way to demonstrate how your wireframes will function once they're coded and built. Here are some screenshots to show off some of the functionality:
