# The Remoter

#### A mock up of a new co-working space coming to the Portland area.

#### By **Brendan Shea**

## Description

This project is mock-up of a fictional co-working space that's coming to the Portland area. The project includes user stories, research, mock-ups in Sketch, prototyping in Sketch, and fully functioning website.

## Getting Started

In order to use this program on your machine, you'll need to install N

## User Stories

## Creative Research & Process

In order to get a feel for the market and the types of companies that are offering co-working spaces, I reviewed the following websites for information and inspiration:

* [The Encorepreneur Cafe](http://encorepreneurcafe.com/)
* [TechSpace](https://www.techspace.com/)
* [WeWork](https://www.wework.com/)
* [Centrl Office](https://centrloffice.com/)
* [Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2015/05/why-people-thrive-in-coworking-spaces)

After reading through and reviewing those resources, I decided that my landing page should be more of a digital experience. I want the user to feel something when they open up the website. I want them to see themselves at this space and creating work that is meaningful to them.

Once I had a feel for the layouts, I began sketching up a very rough draft on what my site will look like on both mobile and web:

## Wireframing with Sketch

I used Sketch on this project to wireframe the different viewports a user will use with this application. First off, let's take a look at the mobile viewport:

Second, let's take a look at the desktop viewport:

![alt text](img/desktop-2.png "Photo of desktop viewport.")
![alt text](img/desktop-3.png "Photo of desktop viewport.")

As you'll see, the mobile viewport condenses into a smaller version of the desktop viewport. The only real change is that the header will turn into a hamburger icon when the user is viewing the website from a mobile device or shrinks their viewport manually.

## Prototyping with Sketch

Sketch also served as a great tool for prototyping. If you're not familiar, prototyping is a way to demonstrate how your wireframes will function once they're coded and built. Here are some screenshots to show off some of the functionality:
